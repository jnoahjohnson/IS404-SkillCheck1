    <h1>Extra</h1>
    <p>
      For the extra part of the assignment I was excited to see if I could use
      AWS and GitHub to have a CI/CD pipeline. I was able to implement this so
      that when I push any code changes then the pipeline transfers over the
      files to the server into the directory to then server them. This let me
      learn a lot about other services that AWS has.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to learn about IAM roles, users, and policies inside of AWS. These
      allowed me to give permissions to use some of the other AWS services and
      to tie them together. I used Code Pipeline to watch for changes from the
      GitHub repository. Then, when a change is pushed, it sends a trigger to
      CodeDeploy. That service then is setup with a policy to allow it to grab
      the code from the GitHub repo and transfer it into the var/www/html
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      I set up this pipeline just with static files to keep it simple, but did
      try many options to get it to work. I tried initially to use
      <a href="https://parceljs.org">Parcel</a> to bundle up all the files,
      though that would have taken more configuration on the server side which
      would be interesting to look into in the future, but I was running into a
      lot of issues so I went back to just the static files. It was interesting
      to also see what tests could be done on AWS with applications that you
      deploy. I have deployed to different services in the past, but they
      usually didn't have as much configuration so it was intersting to see how
      they most likely work behind the scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      My future goal with this information would be to put a static site
      generator on the server so that I could write markdown files on my
      computer, push them to GitHub, and then they generate a website that I can
      view. I am implementing a similar idea for a portfolio and blog site so
      that I can write up what we are working on in class and outside on
      personal projects.
